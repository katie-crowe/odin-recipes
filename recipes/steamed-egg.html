        <h2>Description</h2>

        Steamed egg is simple and easy to make, as long as you have a pot / deep pan and heat-resistant bowl.
        You could even make steamed egg in the microwave, but results may vary (prone to explosion if done incorrectly).

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 or 3 eggs</li>
            <li>Warm (not hot nor cold) water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>(Optional) Salted duck egg</li>
            <li>(Optional) Sliced green onion</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Beat the eggs in the heat-resistant bowl.</li>
            <li>Slowly add the warm water to the egg, while stirring.</li>
            <li>If you would like to add salted duck egg, you can slice a cooked salted duck egg into 2 or 4 pieces
                and add to the egg and water mixture.
            </li>
            <li>Mix in the salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Add enough water to fill 2 inches of the pan or pot.</li>
            <li>For best results, add something into the pan or pot that the bowl can sit on so it is not submerged in the water.</li>
            <li>Turn the stove on to medium high heat.</li>
            <li>Once the water is boiling, add the bowl of the egg mixture into the pan or pot. Make sure to put the lid
                on the pan or pot.
            </li>
            <li>After about 8 minutes, check to see if the egg is cooked by sticking a spoon into the egg.
                If there is some water but the surrounding egg is solid, it is likely ready. If it is watery and the surrounding
                egg is still liquidy, it is not ready. In this case, leave it in the pan or pot and check every 5 minutes or so.
            </li>
            <li>Once the egg is solid, the egg is done! You can add chopped green onion on top to taste.</li>
        </ol>
