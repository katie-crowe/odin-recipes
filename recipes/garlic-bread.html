        <h2>Description</h2>

        This simple garlic bread recipe is perfect for anyone who has a craving for garlic bread but is short on time. The entire
        process takes just about half an hour, and you'll have enough garlic bread to share!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Demi-baguette</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.</li>
            <li>Make slices along the demi-baguette, about 3/4 inch apart. The slices should almost cut through the bread,
                but not completely, so that the bread is left intact and connected.
            </li>
            <li>Soften the butter by putting it in the microwave for 5-10 seconds, or as long as it takes to get it
                soft but not completely melted and liquidy.
            </li>
            <li>Mince the garlic and add to the softened butter.</li>
            <li>Add the salt.</li>
            <li>Once the oven is preheated, place the demi-baguette onto a sheet of foil and close the foil over the demi-baguette
                so that it is completely covered. This will ensure that the bread is soft and not crispy.
            </li>
            <li>After 15 minutes, remove the foil-wrapped demi-baguette from the oven, and serve! It should be easily torn
                apart for sharing.
            </li>
        </ol>
